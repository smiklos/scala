Quick syntax rundown, excluding the hard stuff. Can show extension methods, opaque types too and comp objects. String interpolation, constructor,s case classes and enums. Pattern matching. Etc

Introduction to the main fp concepts. Immutability and pure functions + referential transparency.

More advanced typeclasses with auto derivation for json, compare it with reflection and annotation processor. 

Higher order functions and Monads introduction 

Monadic effect systems, need for ref transp

Direct style alternative with scala 3
