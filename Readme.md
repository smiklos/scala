Quick syntax rundown, excluding the hard stuff. Can show extension methods, opaque types too and comp objects. String interpolation, constructor,s case classes and enums. Pattern matching. Etc

Maybe a more advanced syntax session for that. 

Introduction to the main fp concepts. Immutability and pure functions + referential transparency. 

OOP vs Typeclasses and how given/using help simplify this syntax. 

More advanced typeclasses with auto derivation for json, compare it with reflection and annotation processor. 

Higher order functions and their typeclasses , Functor, Monad etc introduction 

Effect systems (IO monad), need for ref transparency/composability. It's all about composability. Non lazy functions can't be composed.  

Direct style alternative with scala 3

Functional persistence options Inspired by event sourcing
